> PaceCue is a running app that provides real-time voice coaching for interval workouts and pace tracking.

## What PaceCue Does

PaceCue is an iPhone app designed for runners who do structured interval training. It announces interval transitions, current pace, elapsed time, and countdown warnings through voice audio — so runners don't need to check their phone or watch during workouts.

## Key Features

- Real-time GPS pace tracking with voice announcements (min/mile or min/km)
- Structured interval workouts with warmup, hard, easy, and cooldown phases
- Configurable audio cues: voice, beeps, both, or silent with haptics
- AI workout builder: describe a workout in plain English, get a structured plan
- Target pace alerts on individual intervals
- 11 built-in workout presets (5K Speed, Tempo Run, Fartlek, Hill Repeats, Run/Walk, etc.)
- Background operation with screen locked
- Music ducking during announcements
- Workout sharing via links
- iOS Live Activities and home screen widgets
- Cloud sync across devices
- Workout history with per-interval splits and distances

## Who It's For

- Interval runners doing speed work, tempo runs, fartlek, or hill repeats
- Beginners using run/walk programs
- Pace-conscious runners who want audio feedback without screen-checking
- Self-coached runners who want structured workout guidance
