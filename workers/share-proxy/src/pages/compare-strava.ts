      <p>An honest comparison — two apps that serve very different roles in a runner's toolkit.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>SplitCue</strong> is an interval training app with real-time voice pace coaching, a custom workout builder, and an AI workout generator. It's designed to guide you <em>during</em> the run with audio cues.</p>
        <p><strong>Strava</strong> is a GPS tracking and social fitness platform. It records your runs (and rides, swims, hikes), maps routes, tracks performance over time, and connects you with a large community of athletes through segments, clubs, and leaderboards.</p>
        <p>These apps don't really compete — they complement each other. But here's a detailed comparison.</p>

        <h2>Where Strava Is Better</h2>
        <p>Strava is stronger in almost every category that isn't real-time interval coaching:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Post-run analysis.</strong> Strava's training log, pace analysis, elevation profiles, and fitness trends are far more detailed. SplitCue stores basic split data.</li>
          <li><strong>Route mapping.</strong> Strava maps every run with GPS and lets you plan routes. SplitCue doesn't map routes.</li>
          <li><strong>Social community.</strong> Strava is the social network for runners. Segments, clubs, kudos, and challenges are core to the experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-sport support.</strong> Strava covers running, cycling, swimming, hiking, and more. SplitCue is running only.</li>
          <li><strong>Platform support.</strong> Strava works on iOS, Android, web, and integrates with GPS watches from Garmin, Apple, COROS, and others.</li>
          <li><strong>Watch integrations.</strong> Strava syncs with virtually every running watch and fitness tracker.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Where SplitCue Is Better</h2>
        <p>SplitCue fills a gap that Strava doesn't address:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Interval training with voice coaching.</strong> Strava records your run but doesn't tell you when to start your next interval or what your current set is. SplitCue guides every transition with audio.</li>
          <li><strong>Custom workout builder.</strong> Create any interval structure with blocks, repeats, and target paces. Strava has no equivalent.</li>
          <li><strong>Frequent pace announcements.</strong> Hear your pace every 15–120 seconds, not just at mile markers.</li>
          <li><strong>AI workout generation.</strong> Describe a workout and get a structured plan instantly.</li>
          <li><strong>Hands-free, screen-off operation.</strong> SplitCue is designed to run entirely through audio with your phone locked in your pocket.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Using Them Together</h2>
        <p>SplitCue and Strava serve different roles. Many runners will benefit from both:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use <strong>SplitCue</strong> to coach you through interval workouts with real-time audio guidance.</li>
          <li>Use <strong>Strava</strong> to log your training, track fitness over time, plan routes, and connect with other runners.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>SplitCue doesn't try to replace Strava's tracking and social features. Strava doesn't try to coach your intervals.</p>
