        <h2>How the AI Builder Works</h2>
        <p>PaceCue's AI Workout Builder takes a natural-language description and generates a fully structured interval workout with warmup, work intervals, recovery, and cooldown — ready to run immediately.</p>

        <p>Examples of prompts you can use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>"A 30-minute tempo run with a warmup and cooldown"</em></li>
          <li><em>"8 × 400m repeats at 5K pace with 90 seconds recovery"</em></li>
          <li><em>"Something similar to what I ran last week but a bit harder"</em></li>
          <li><em>"A beginner run/walk program, 25 minutes total"</em></li>
          <li><em>"Pyramid intervals going 1-2-3-4-3-2-1 minutes"</em></li>
          <li><em>"A hill repeat workout for half marathon training"</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Context-Aware Generation</h2>
        <p>The AI builder can use context from your <strong>running profile and workout history</strong> to generate workouts that fit your fitness level. If you've been running 7:30 pace in your recent workouts, the AI can set target paces accordingly rather than guessing.</p>
        <p>You can also have a <strong>conversation</strong> with the builder — ask it to make the workout harder, add more recovery, change the interval lengths, or adjust the warmup. The AI remembers what it already built and modifies it.</p>

        <h2>What the AI Generates</h2>
        <p>The output is a standard PaceCue workout with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Named warmup, main, and cooldown phases</li>
          <li>Interval durations, labels, and types</li>
          <li>Block repeat counts</li>
          <li>Optional target paces and effort ratings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once generated, the workout appears in your workout list. You can edit any part of it manually — change durations, add or remove intervals, adjust target paces — and then run it with full voice coaching like any other PaceCue workout.</p>

        <h2>Example: Generating a Speed Session</h2>
        <p>If you type <em>"6 × 3 minutes hard with 2 minutes easy, plus a 10-minute warmup"</em>, the AI builder creates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 × 10-minute warmup</li>
          <li>6 × (3 minutes hard / 2 minutes easy)</li>
          <li>1 × 5-minute cooldown</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Total: approximately 45 minutes. PaceCue assigns appropriate labels, and you can add target paces to the hard intervals before starting.</p>

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The AI builder requires a PaceCue account (free to create) and an internet connection.</li>
          <li>AI-generated workouts should be reviewed before running — especially target paces, which the AI estimates from your history or your prompt.</li>
          <li>The AI builder creates time-based intervals. If you request distance-based intervals (e.g., "800m repeats"), the AI estimates an equivalent duration based on your fitness level.</li>
        </ul>
