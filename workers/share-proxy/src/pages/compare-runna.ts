      <h1>SplitCue vs Runna</h1>
      <p>Two running apps with voice coaching — but built for different kinds of runners.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>SplitCue</strong> is an interval training app with real-time voice pace coaching, a flexible custom workout builder, and an AI workout generator. You build or generate individual workouts and SplitCue coaches you through them with audio cues.</p>
        <p><strong>Runna</strong> is a structured training plan app. You choose a race distance and goal, and Runna generates a multi-week training program with daily workouts. Each workout includes voice guidance during the run. It's designed to take you from where you are to race day.</p>
        <p>The key difference: SplitCue gives you freedom to build any workout you want. Runna gives you a coach-designed plan and tells you what to do each day.</p>

        <h2>Where Runna Is Better</h2>
        <p>Runna is the stronger choice if you want a coach telling you what to do every day:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Complete training plans.</strong> Runna builds an entire training block — from base building through taper — for any race distance. SplitCue handles individual workouts, not multi-week periodization.</li>
          <li><strong>Adaptive progression.</strong> Runna adjusts your plan based on how runs go. SplitCue doesn't automatically progress your training.</li>
          <li><strong>Race-specific preparation.</strong> Runna's plans are built around your goal race time and adjust paces accordingly across all workout types.</li>
          <li><strong>Watch integration.</strong> Runna pushes workouts to Garmin and Apple Watch. SplitCue is phone-only.</li>
          <li><strong>Expert-designed programming.</strong> Runna's plans are built by running coaches with structured periodization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Where SplitCue Is Better</h2>
        <p>SplitCue is the better choice if you want control over your own workouts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Full workout customization.</strong> Build any interval structure you can imagine — any number of blocks, any durations, any labels, any repeats. Runna's workouts are plan-generated and not user-editable in the same way.</li>
          <li><strong>Configurable pace announcements.</strong> Hear your pace every 15–120 seconds with adjustable GPS smoothing. Much more control than Runna's audio feedback.</li>
          <li><strong>AI workout generation.</strong> Describe a workout in natural language and get a structured plan. Useful for one-off sessions or creative training.</li>
          <li><strong>Free to use.</strong> SplitCue's core features are free. Runna requires a subscription that typically costs $15–20/month.</li>
          <li><strong>No commitment required.</strong> SplitCue is good for runners who don't want a rigid training plan but still want structured workouts with voice coaching.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When to Use Which</h2>
        <p><strong>Use Runna</strong> if you're training for a specific race and want a structured, adaptive training plan that tells you exactly what to do each day. Especially valuable for runners new to structured training or preparing for their first race at a given distance.</p>
        <p><strong>Use SplitCue</strong> if you prefer building your own workouts, want granular control over interval timing and audio feedback, or want a free tool for structured speed work without committing to a training plan subscription.</p>
        <p>Some runners use Runna for their overall plan structure and SplitCue for custom speed sessions that go beyond what the plan provides.</p>
