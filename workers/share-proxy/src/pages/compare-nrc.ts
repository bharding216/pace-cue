        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>PaceCue</strong> is an interval training app with real-time voice pace coaching, a custom workout builder, and an AI workout generator. It's focused on structured workouts and hands-free audio feedback.</p>
        <p><strong>Nike Run Club (NRC)</strong> is a free, all-purpose running app with guided audio runs narrated by Nike coaches, GPS tracking, training plans, and a social community. It covers running more broadly — from casual jogs to marathon training.</p>
        <p>These apps solve different problems. Here's where each one is stronger.</p>

        <h2>Where Nike Run Club Is Better</h2>
        <p>NRC is a better choice if you want:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Guided coached runs.</strong> NRC's library of narrated runs with coaches like Coach Bennett is genuinely motivating. PaceCue doesn't have pre-recorded coach content.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-week training plans.</strong> NRC offers structured plans that progress over weeks toward a race goal. PaceCue handles individual workouts, not periodized training.</li>
          <li><strong>Social and community features.</strong> NRC has challenges, leaderboards, and the ability to run with friends. PaceCue has no social features.</li>
          <li><strong>Music integration.</strong> NRC integrates with Spotify and offers curated playlists. PaceCue ducks your music during cues but doesn't control playback.</li>
          <li><strong>Android support.</strong> NRC is available on both iOS and Android. PaceCue is currently iOS only.</li>
          <li><strong>Completely free.</strong> NRC has no subscription or premium tier.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Where PaceCue Is Better</h2>
        <p>PaceCue is a better choice if you want:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Custom interval workouts.</strong> PaceCue lets you build any interval structure — any number of blocks, any durations, any labels, with repeat counts. NRC doesn't have a custom interval builder.</li>
          <li><strong>Frequent, configurable pace announcements.</strong> PaceCue can announce your pace every 15 seconds with GPS smoothing. NRC's audio feedback is less frequent and not configurable.</li>
          <li><strong>Target pace alerts.</strong> Set a target pace on individual intervals and hear whether you're on pace, too fast, or too slow. NRC doesn't offer per-interval target pacing.</li>
          <li><strong>AI-generated workouts.</strong> Describe what you want and get a structured workout instantly.</li>
          <li><strong>Hands-free operation.</strong> PaceCue is designed to run entirely in the background with all information delivered through audio. You never need to look at your phone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When to Use Which</h2>
        <p><strong>Use Nike Run Club</strong> if you're looking for a general-purpose running companion with coaching motivation, training plans, and social features — especially if you're newer to running or want guided runs.</p>
        <p><strong>Use PaceCue</strong> if you do structured interval training and want precise control over your workout structure with hands-free voice coaching and real-time pace feedback.</p>
        <p>Many runners use both — NRC for easy runs and training plan guidance, PaceCue for speed work and custom interval sessions.</p>
